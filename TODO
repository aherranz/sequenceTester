TOOD list
=========

- Check that UnitTest tests have unique names.

- We should be able to refer to return values with the symbolic names
of calls, and use them as arguments. In this way we can probably remove
the controller, and let the monitor (or CSP) creation be a normal event.

Maybe the syntax value(symbolic_var). This has the problem that
we cannot check such references statically, instead they will result
in a runtime error.

   TestCall.unblock(Call.returns("counter",new Counter()));
   TestCall.unblocks(new Set(value("counter"),3)),
   TestCall.blocks(Call.returns("await",new Await(value("counter"),4))),
   TestCall.unblocks(Call.returns(new Dec(value("counter"),2))).run();
