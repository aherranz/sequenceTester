  The sequenceTester library is a Java library
  used for writing and testing unit tests
  for a possibly non-sequential APIs, i.e.,
  were calls may block. The library has been used to test
  exercises in the undergraduate
course "Concurrencia" at the Escuela Tecnica Superior
  de Ingenieros Informaticos at the Un
  iversidad Politecnica de Madrid, Spain.

<h1>Unit Tests</h1>
<p>
A unit test is an instance of the class
{@link es.upm.babel.sequenceTester.TestStmt}. A test statement is either:
<dl>
  <dt>{@link es.upm.babel.sequenceTester.Nil}</dt>
  <dd>A test statement which always succeeds.</dd>

  <dt>{@link es.upm.babel.sequenceTester.Prefix}(TestCall call, TestStatement stmt)</dt>
  <dd>A test statement
  which first executes the TestCall call, and if that succeeds, then
  continues with succeeding TestStatement stmt.</dd>
  <dt>{@link es.upm.babel.sequenceTester.Branches}(Call[] calls, Alternative... alternatives)</dt>
  <dd>
  A branch statement can handle nondeterminism in the tested
  program. First the calls are executed in parallel then
  the alternatives are checked to see if any of them can explain the
  result of executing the parallel calls. 
  An alternative is an array describing which parallel calls
  were unblocked. That is for an alternative to match
  all unblocked parallel calls must be
  mentioned in the alternative unblock array),
  and a continuation statement which is used to continue the test.
  </dd>
</dl>
</p>
<h1>Call</h1>
<p>
  An instance of the {@link es.upm.babel.sequenceTester.Call} class is a recipe for making
  a call, and an oracle which decides if the invocation of
  the call returned the correct result. A call may be given
  a symbolic name, which is useful to specify that it is later
  (during the execution of another call) unblocked.
</p>
<h1>TestCall</h1>
<p>
  An instance of the {@link es.upm.babel.sequenceTester.TestCall} class
  executes a set of calls in parallel, and checks that
  the correct calls are blocked and unblocked.
  The TestCall has a constructor
  <pre>
    {@code
TestCall(Call[] calls,
         int[] mustUnblock,
         Result[] mustUnblockResults,
         int[] mayUnblock,
         Result[] mayUnblockResults)
   }
</pre>
  The calls are executed in parallel,
  mustUnblock specifies the calls that <em>must</em> have been unblocked
  (including potentially earlier calls),
  mayUnblock specifies the calls that <em>may</em> have been unblocked
  (including potentially earlier calls),
  and the Result arrays codes the oracles for deciding if
  the unblocked calls returned correct values (or raised the
  correct exceptions).

  <h1>An Example</h1>
<p>
  Suppose we have an API with three method: set(int),
  dec(), and whenZero() such that set(int) sets the value of a counter
  to the argument and always unblocks immediately,
  dec() decrements the value of the
  counter by 1 and always unblocks immediately, whereas
  a call to whenZero() unblocks when the value of the counter becomes 0.
</p>
<p>An example unit test for this API may then be:
  <pre>
{@code
Prefix
(TestCall.unblocks(new Set(3)),
 Prefix
 (TestCall.unblocks(new Dec()),
  Prefix
  (TestCall.blocks("whenZero",new WhenZero()),
   Prefix
   (TestCall.unblocks(new Dec()),
    Prefix
    (TestCall.unblocks(new Dec(), "whenZero"),
     Nil)))))
}
  </pre>
  Given constructors Set(int), Dec() and WhenZero() which creates
  instances of a Call (sub)class,
  the test expresses that if we first set the counter to 3
  (a call which immediately returns, i.e., "unblocks"),
  and then decrement the counter
  (a call which immediately returns),
  and if we next call whenZero() that call blocks (does not return);
  note that we give the call to whenZero() the symbolic name "whenZero".
  If next we decrement the counter again that call immediately
  returns. Finally if we again call dec() again
  then both that call returned immediately, <b>and</b>
  also the earlier call to whenZero() returned ("unblocked").
</p>
<p>Using the library API we can write this unit more compactly as a sequence:
<pre>
{@code
TestCall.unblocks(new Set(3)),
TestCall.unblocks(new Dec()),
TestCall.blocks("whenZero",new WhenZero()),
TestCall.unblocks(new Dec()),
TestCall.unblocks(new Dec(), "whenZero")
}
</pre>
</p>  
<p>
  Suppose next we modify the dec() method to return the value
  of the counter after the decrement operation,
  and that we wish to check that value in the unit test,
  i.e., defining oracles. This can be done using the code:
<pre>
{@code
TestCall.unblocks(new Set(3)),
TestCall.unblocks(Call.returns(new Dec(),2)),
TestCall.blocks("whenZero",new WhenZero()),
TestCall.unblocks(Call.returns(new Dec(),1),
TestCall.unblocks(Call.returns(new Dec(),0), "whenZero")
}
</pre>
Note that we have embedded the call specification new Dec()
inside a call to return, e.g., Call.return(new Dec(),2),
which indicates that the call should return the value 2.
<p>
  Note that using the library API
  for blocking calls we can either specify
  the return value at the time of making the call, or
  when the call is unblocked.
  </p>
